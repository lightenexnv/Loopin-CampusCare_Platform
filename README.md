# Loopin 🚀  
*A Unified Campus Community Platform*

## 📌 About the Project
Loopin is a centralized campus community platform designed to replace fragmented WhatsApp-based communication with a single, structured, and inclusive system. It ensures that no student misses important academic groups, club activities, events, or shared learning resources.

The platform organizes campus interactions by branch, section, and subject, reducing information overload and creating a transparent, campus-owned ecosystem for collaboration and communication.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In most colleges, students are added to multiple WhatsApp groups for clubs, academics, and events. This leads to:
- Missed or delayed information  
- Students being excluded from important groups  
- Information clutter and duplication  
- No single trusted source for official communication  

Loopin solves this by bringing everything into **one unified platform**.
